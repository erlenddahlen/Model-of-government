# Model-of-government

This is a model of the economy where the governmet, firms, public and private sector are aggregated into first-order transfer functions and then connected via flows of money. 

The idea is to make the government act as a counter-cyclical agent in response to employment rate, with deficit/surplus spending and a dynamic setting of taxes. 

Work to be done: 
- Make employment function more realistic. So far it is employment=(o+p)/salary
- Make a function for the dynamic tax-setting
- Simulate system and test if the model makes sense in various scenarios
- Make government able to successfully re-adjust employment in face of a shock
